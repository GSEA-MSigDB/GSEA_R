\description{
`GSEA.SeqRanking` computes the GSEA ranking metric for each gene in the gene raw counts matrix using DESeq2
}
\details{
Compute the GSEA ranking metric for each gene in the gene list. 
This function ranks the genes for the actual phenotype and also random 
permutations and bootstrap subsamples of both the observed and random 
phenotypes. It uses matrix operations to implement the rank calculations 
in stages and achieves fast execution speed. It supports two types of 
permutations: random (unbalanced) and balanced.  It also supports 
subsampling and bootstrap by using masking and multiple-count variables.
When 'fraction' is set to 1 (default) the there is no subsampling or 
boostrapping and the matrix of observed rank metrics will have the
same value for all permutations. This is wasteful but allows to support all the
multiple options with the same code. Notice that the second matrix for the null
distribution will still have the values for the random permutations (null
distribution). This mode (fraction = 1.0) is the default, the recommended one
and the one used in the examples. It is also the one that has be tested more
thoroughly. The resampling and boostrapping options are intersting to obtain
smooth estimates of the observed distribution but its is left for the expert
user who may want to perform some sanity checks before trusting the code.
Inputs: A: Matrix of gene expression values (rows are genes, columns are
samples) class.labels: Phenotype of class disticntion of interest. A vector of
binary labels having first the 1's and then the 0's gene.labels: gene labels.
Vector of probe ids or accession numbers for the rows of the expression matrix
nperm: Number of random permutations/bootstraps to perform permutation.type:
Permutation type: 0 = unbalanced, 1 = balanced. For experts only (default: 0)
sigma.correction: Correction to the signal to noise ratio (Default =
GeneCluster, a choice to support the way it was handled in a previous package)
fraction: Subsampling fraction. Set to 1.0 (no resampling). For experts only
(default: 1.0) replace: Resampling mode (replacement or not replacement). For
experts only (default: F) reverse.sign: Reverse direction of gene list (default
= F) rank.metric: metric to use for ranking genes, supports 'change' which ranks 
by the DESeq2 computed Log2(FC), 'signedsig' which ranks by the  * the Sign of 
the Log2(FC), and 'scaledchange' which ranks by the DESeq2 computed 
Log2(FC)*-log10(DESeq2 pValue), Outputs: rnk.matrix: Matrix with 
random permuted or bootstraps rank metrics signal to noise ratios by default 
(rows are genes, columns are permutations or bootstrap subsamplings 
obs.rnk.matrix: Matrix with observed rank metrics (rows are genes, columns 
are boostraps subsamplings. If fraction is set to 1.0 then all the columns 
have the same values order.matrix: Matrix with the orderings that will sort 
the columns of the obs.rnk.matrix in decreasing rnk order obs.order.matrix: 
Matrix with the orderings that will sort the columns of the rnk.matrix in 
decreasing rnk order.
